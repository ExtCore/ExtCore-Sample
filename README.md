## Introduction

[ExtCore](https://github.com/ExtCore/ExtCore) is free, open source and cross-platform framework for creating
modular and extendable web applications based on ASP.NET Core. It is built using the best and the most modern
tools and languages (Visual Studio 2015, C# etc). Join our team!

This is the full-featured ExtCore framework sample web application.

## Getting Started

* rebuild the solution;
* copy extensions DLL files into the Extensions folder of the main web application (this folder doesn’t exist by default,
so you need to create it in the web application root or specify another location in the config.json file; also you may just
add direct dependencies to the extensions in the project.json file of the main web application, but it is not so interesting);
* run the main web application.
